# translation-service
This repository contains the implementation of a translation service API that utilizes various SLMs to provide translations between Turkish, English, and Arabic. The service is designed to operate both synchronously via RESTful APIs and asynchronously using Apache Kafka, supporting high-volume text translations with robust fault tolerance.
